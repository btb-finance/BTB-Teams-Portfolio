## 4. Uploading Your Profile

**Purpose:**
Provide a simple guide for team members to upload their profiles, ensuring they only need to modify files within their own profile directory.

### Steps to Upload Your Profile

1. **Create Your Profile Directory:**

   - Inside the `Teams/` directory, create a new folder named with your unique ID and name. Example:
     ```
     Teams/001-JohnDoe/
     ```
   - Use the following command to create the directory and necessary subdirectories:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p Teams/001-JohnDoe/{Projects,Certificates}
     ```

2. **Add Your `README.md`:**

   - Create a `README.md` file inside your profile directory (`Teams/001-JohnDoe/README.md`) with the following template:

     ```markdown
     # Profile: [Your Full Name]

     ## Personal Information

     - **Name:** [Your Full Name]

   - You only need to edit this `README.md` within your own profile directory.

3. **Add Your Projects:**

   - Inside your `Projects/` folder (`Teams/001-JohnDoe/Projects/`), create a separate folder for each project:

     ```
   - Each project folder should contain:
     - Project files (code, documentation, etc.)
     - A `README.md` describing the project.

   git add Teams/001-JohnDoe
   git commit -m "Add profile for [Your Full Name]"
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request:**

   - Open a Pull Request in the main `BTB-Teams-Portfolio` repository to add your profile directory.

## Final Notes

- **Consistency:** Ensure that all internal links in your own `README.md` files are correct.
- **Placeholders:** Replace placeholders like `[Your Full Name]`, `[Your Unique ID]`, and `[your.email@example.com]` with your actual details.
- **Privacy:** Only include information and files that you are comfortable sharing publicly.
- **Email Addresses:** Since BTB Finance doesn't provide unique emails for each team member, please use your personal email addresses in your profiles.

By following these simplified steps, you can easily create your own profile within the repository without the need to change or add any other files outside your own profile directory. This approach ensures the portfolio remains organized and professional while making the process straightforward for all team members.
